Results in code/index.Rmd file. 

GitHub-pages at the following link:

The index.html show at the end random forest result with 98% accuracy.(as also mentioned in the text of the Rmd and Github pages)
However, as known for random forest, it took very long to run.

In my final prediction, I used boosting as given in index.Rmd (but commented with #) 
(index.html and Rmd not updated due to long running time random forest)

The boosting reached accuracy of 96% with following parameters:
The final values used for the model were n.trees = 150, interaction.depth = 3, shrinkage =
 0.1 and n.minobsinnode = 10.
